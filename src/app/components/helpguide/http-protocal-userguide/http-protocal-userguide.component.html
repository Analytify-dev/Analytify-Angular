                <h6>Step 1: Set up a firewall for your server:</h6>
                <p>You should have a regular, non-root user with sudo privileges configured on your server. Additionally, you will need to enable a basic firewall to block non-essential ports. 
                    You can learn how to configure a regular user account and set up a firewall for your server by following below steps
                </p>

                    <h6>1. Login as root</h6>
                    <p>To log into your server, you will need to know your server’s public IP address. You will also need the password or — if you installed an SSH key for authentication — the private 
                        key for the root user’s account. If you have not already logged into your server,If you are not already connected to your server, log in now as the root user using the following command 
                        (substitute the highlighted portion of the command with your server’s public IP address):
                    </p>
                    <span class="tag bg-light fs-14 mb-3">ssh root your_server_ip</span>
                    <p>Accept the warning about host authenticity if it appears. If you are using password authentication, provide your root password to log in. If you are using an SSH key that is passphrase protected, 
                        you may be prompted to enter the passphrase the first time you use the key each session. If this is your first time logging into the server with a password, you may also be prompted to change the 
                        root password.

                    <p>Now we have a new user account with regular account privileges. However, we may sometimes need to do administrative tasks.</p>
                    <p>To add privileges to our new user, we need to add the user to the sudo group. By default, on Ubuntu 20.04, users who are members of the sudo group are allowed to use the sudo command.</p>
                    <p>As root, run this command to add your new user to the sudo group (substitute the highlighted username with your new user):</p>
                    <span class="tag bg-light fs-14 mb-3">usermod -aG sudo  < username></span>
                    <p>Now, when logged in as your regular user, you can type sudo before commands to run them with superuser privileges. </p>
